## MicroK8s Charm

### Overview

```bash
# deploy 3 control plane nodes, 3 worker nodes
juju deploy microk8s -n 3
juju deploy microk8s microk8s-worker -n 3 --config role=worker

# connect worker nodes to the control plane
juju relate microk8s:microk8s-provides microk8s-worker:microk8s
```

The control plane nodes will automatically form a 3-node cluster. The worker nodes will stay in a waiting state until they are related to the control plane.

### State

| Charm Role | State       | Value                                          | Description                                                                                                                 |

| all        | `role`      | `""`, `"control-plane"` or `"worker"`          | set to `config["role"]` when the charm is deployed, to prevent the role from changing afterwards                            |
| all        | `installed` | `true` or `false`                              | set to `true` after MicroK8s is installed                                                                                   |
| all        | `joined`    | `true` or `false`                              | set to `true` after joining the cluster successfully                                                                        |
| all        | `leaving`   | `true` or `false`                              | set to `true` if leaving the cluster (relation broken)                                                                      |
| all        | `join_url`  | `"$IP_ADDRESS:25000/$TOKEN"`                   | for units other than the bootstrap control plane node, store the URL that is used to join the cluster                       |
| all        | `hostnames` | `{"microk8s/0": "juju-roasted-beef42-0", ...}` | mapping of unit names to hostnames. recorded by all control plane nodes and used to remove departing nodes from the cluster |

### Clustering

#### Control Plane

When deploying the charm with `role=""` or `role="control-plane"`, the charm will bootstrap a control plane and automatically cluster all peers. The state machine implemented by the charm is shown in the figure below:

![control plane](./fsm/control-plane.png)

- The leader unit generates and shares a `join_url` for joining other (control plane or worker) nodes to the cluster. The join_url is shared using the `peer` (follower units) and `microk8s-provides` (worker units) relations.
- All control plane units announce their hostname through the `peer` relation.
- The leader unit takes care of removing nodes (using `microk8s remove-node --force`) after they have left the cluster.

#### Worker

When deploying the charm with `role="worker"`, the charm will deploy worker-only nodes. The nodes will wait for a `microk8s` relation to an existing microk8s control plane application.
