options:
  role:
    description: |
      Role for MicroK8s deployment, one of "", "control-plane" or "worker".

      Set the role to "control-plane" or "" to deploy all units as control plane nodes and form an
      HA control plane.

      Set the role to "worker" to deploy all units as workers. When deploying workers, the units
      will remain in waiting status until they are related to a microk8s control plane.

      The charm role cannot and must not be changed after deployment. Doing so will cause the units
      to go into error state until the change is reverted.
    default: ""
    type: string
  automatic_certificate_reissue:
    description: |
      By default, MicroK8s will automatically regenerate server certificates when the IP address
      of the host machine changes. This is problematic in scenarios where a bridge is configured
      on the host and IP addresses on the bridge are changed frequently.

      Set this flag to false if that is the case to prevent MicroK8s from continuously restarting
      and affecting the service.

      This option is ignored and does not have any effect on multi-node clusters.
    default: true
    type: boolean
